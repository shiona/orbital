# Orbital

## What?

A visualizer for Reaktor Orbital challenge, where the task was to find a path
from a ground station to another via a given set of satellites.

## Why

I wanted to get some understanding of the then modern OpenGL (post 2.0)

## It doesn't work!

I'm using textures that are large enough that I'm not going to put them up on github, at least for now.

## Umm... about the models.cc

Yea, I know. Using actual models would be

 - More appropriate
 - Easier
 - More maintainable
 - Actually sane

But I wanted to do some 3d math.
